* BBK-SDP-2015-EXAM_PRACTICE
-----

The intent of the exercise is to help you to think in a functional manner.
To that end, you will have to complete the LinkedList API outlined in the
src directory. There are companion tests in the test directory that make
sure that the output is the same as the List API. All but three functions
in the API have the same signature as the List API. The other three are
there for helpful and/or instructional purposes. I hope that you find
this helpful.
-----
** Rules
Since this is to help you think in a functional way there are some rules
to follow.

*** No for loops, while loops and do whiles. The only way to iterate over a list is to use recursion.
*** No mutating state. everything should be immutable from creation of an object
-----
*** Tests
***** To get the tests to work, I have marked in the test file with "TODO"s.
***** Under the TODOs are lines that start with an "ignore", swap out the word ignore with "describe" to open a block of tests.

I will be posting sample solutions two days before the Exam. I wish you all
the best of luck.
